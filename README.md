# fareFlight
Here at fareFlight, we believe everybody should have the opportunity to expand their horizons through travel. 
Our goal is to provide a simple-to-use application that will retrieve the most inexpensive flight from any available Carrier 
throughout the internet and display that information right on the user's screen with the click of a button. The User will have the 
choice to click a link which will take them to that specific Carrier's website where they can proceed to purchase their ticket(s).

## Motivation
Often times with other flight scrapers across the web, the User will be bombarded with unneccessary information. The competing app 
may be influenced by a Carrier to display their flights at the top. With fareFlight, you will receive the most necessary information, 
and the most inexpensive flight option available from your selected Origin to your selected Destination. After a flight is found, 
a link is provided to send you to the Carrier's site for actual purchase. With today's fear of personal data breaches, our app 
specifically will not collect any User data.
